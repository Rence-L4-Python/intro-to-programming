# Names

## Store the names of a few of your friends in a list called names. Print each personâ€™s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.


##### Attempt
print('Version 1:\n')

names=["Arthur", "John", "Charles"]
print(names[0])
print(names[1])
print(names[2])

### Test version, for loop - to print all the names sequentially
print('\n\n[Personal Activity]\n')
for people in names:
    print(people)
print("\n")

exit()
